# Chest-Xray Project
# AI PROJECT ON PNEUMONIA CHEST X-RAY CLASSIFICATION
# BUSINESS CASE:- Based on the image data we need to predict the X-ray is normal or pneumonia. 
## INTRODUCTION :- 
* Pneumonia is a lung inflammation caused by a viral or bacterial infection that can range from mild to severe cases. This inflammation makes the patient unable to breathe enough oxygen to reach the bloodstream. It happens when an infection makes the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs fill with fluid or pus that might affect either one or both lungs. If your doctor thinks you might have pneumonia, a chest X-ray will be performed to find the infection in the patient's lungs and how far itâ€™s spread.

### How can you tell pneumonia from an X-ray ?
* When interpreting the x-ray, the radiologist will look for white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) that identify an infection. This exam will also help determine if you have any complications related to pneumonia such as abscesses or pleural effusions (fluid surrounding the lungs).

## DATA SUMMARY :- 
**The Data set is contain total 8,546 images of Pneumonia patient chest x-ray , include three class [Normal,pneumonia]**

**Classes :-**

1. NORMAL
2. PNEUMONIA
